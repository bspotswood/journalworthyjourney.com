Zion National Park is one of our favorite national parks. Soaring rock faces that go up hundreds of feet surround you as you travel down the roads or along the trails within the park. It has this scale and closeness that is hard to find anywhere else.

The scenic drive road is often closed to general traffic. Such was the case when we attempted to visit the park, but this gave us the incentive to instead get out and try riding it by bike. This is the way to go! It was an easy enough ride that Tayler was able to do it while still recovering from her fractured rib.
