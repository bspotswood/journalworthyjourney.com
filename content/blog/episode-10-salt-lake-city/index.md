We moved on from St George in southern Utah to Aspen Grove RV Park in the city of Tremonton in the north. With a new location comes new opportunities to visit things. In this video, we go down town to see the Utah capitol building and the Mormon temple in Salt Lake City. We found the temple grounds were mostly torn up and are undergoing major renovations, continuing on until at least 2025.
