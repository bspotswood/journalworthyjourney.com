Horseshoe Bend is truly a must-see sight! It is a part of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area near the border of Arizona and Utah. It was carved out by the Colorado River. Stepping up to the edge will give you a jaw (and possibly stomach) dropping view of 1,500 feet down to a curve in the shape of a horseshoe.
