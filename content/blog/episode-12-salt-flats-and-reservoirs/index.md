This is our last video from northern Utah before heading out and onward to Idaho. We recap some of the other great things to see and do, which definitely includes a number of reservoirs and the best hit (in my opinion) for adrenaline junkies … the Bonneville Salt Flats! We visited this historic segment of land that, unsurprisingly given the name, is covered in salt and very flat. This is where land speed records have been set and where you can try your own luck driving on it. We took the truck and our drone out for a little play time on the salt, hitting a top speed of 80 miles per hour. I can’t imagine going hundreds of miles per hour out there, but some do!
